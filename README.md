# Full-Stack-Developer
The task involves creating a backend solution with a REST API, user authentication, database management, and integration of services. You will need to focus on handling operations such as user creation, updating data, and ensuring data security. Implementing automated tests and optimizing the code for scalability and efficiency are essential aspects.
The first part of the task involves setting up a backend solution, focusing on creating a RESTful API. This includes designing endpoints for user registration, login, and profile management. You'll also need to handle user data securely and ensure proper authentication and validation.
To start with creating a RESTful API for user authentication (registration, login, and profile management), we can proceed with the following steps:

Setup:

Choose a backend framework (e.g., Django, Flask, Express).
Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB).
Create Models:

Define the User model with fields like username, email, password (hashed), etc.
Authentication:

Use JWT or sessions for secure user authentication.
Create endpoints like /register, /login, /profile.
Validation and Error Handling:

Validate inputs (e.g., email format, password strength).
Handle errors gracefully (e.g., invalid credentials, user already exists).
To start building the backend for user authentication and profile management, follow these steps:

1. Setup Environment:
Choose a backend framework (e.g., Flask, Django, or Express).
Install dependencies:
For Python (Flask/Django): pip install flask flask-jwt-extended flask_sqlalchemy (or similar for Django).
For Node (Express): npm install express bcryptjs jsonwebtoken mongoose.
2. Create Models (User Model):
Define the User model with fields like username, email, password (hashed).
3. Create API Endpoints:
Register Endpoint: Handle user registration.
Login Endpoint: Implement JWT-based login.
Profile Endpoint: Retrieve user profile details.
4. Add JWT Authentication:
Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate requests.
5. Database Integration:
Use a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to store user data securely.
6. Validation and Error Handling:
Validate user inputs like email, password, etc.
Return meaningful error messages when input is invalid or user exists.
7. Deployment:
When ready, deploy the application to a cloud provider or a service like Heroku or AWS.
